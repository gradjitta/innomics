   <p>In this tutorial you are going to learn how to write basic programs in perl.As this tutorial is specifically for biology/bioinformatics students,most of the examples and practice questions are related to biology.</p>  
   <p>Let us start with a simple program !!!!<br>
   <PRE>
       #!usr/bin/perl 
       print "Hello! world";
       EXIT;
       </PRE>
       </p>
  <p>Type these lines or copy the code above in your favourite perl editor (like Notepad)and save it as first.pl<br>
  Make sure that you have saved it in .pl format. Now go to command prompt,and change current working directory to the one in which you saved your program i.e<br>
  suppose you  have saved your first.pl in the directory "c:\examples" .. Now to change your command prompt to this directory,first open you command prompt window and type the following command<br><b>cd\</b> and now the following command<br><b>cd examples</b>. Now the command prompt changes to<br>
  C:\examples\><br>
  Now type perl first.pl<br>
  C:\examples\>perl first.pl<br>
  </p>
  <p>If everything goes correct you will see the following output<br>
  Hello! world<br>
  </p>
  <p>Now its time to see what the code above actually meant </p>
  <p><b>#!usr/bin/perl</b><br>
This line is known as <i><b>shebang</b></i> line. This line should be included on the top of every perl program.This line tells the parser(Parser is the engine which converts your perl program into machine readable language i.e 0's and 1's)that it is a perl program.</p>
<p><b>print</b><br>
print is a function which prints the output to screen.(We can also redirect output to  files.I shall talk about it later).</p>
<p><b>EXIT</b><br>
EXIT command tells the parser that it is the end of the perl program.EXIT command is optional in any program but it is suggested</p>
<p> Now its time to have a closer look at print function!!</p>
<p> print is a function which returns the standard ouput to the screen.standard output is the output which is generated by your perl program.
As print is a function it accepts arguments which are to be printed on to screen.<br>
<b>Ex: print "AGTCATCGGTACGCTGCCC";</b><br>
You can send as many arguments you want to the print statement seperated by commas i.e <br>
<b> print "AGC","GTC","TCA";</b><br>
This statement prints <b>AGCGTCTCA</b> to the screeen.
<br>
you can also send arguments to the print enclosed by brackets<br>
<b>print ("AGC","GTC","TCA");</b>(Same as the above print statement)</p>

<h3 style="text-decoration:underline;">Datatypes and variables</h3>
<p>Any programmming language is designed to work on data efficiently. This data is stored into placeholders called variables.
In C/C++ we have lots of datatypes like int,float,string,struct,pointers etc etc.C/C++ are called strictly typed languages.A strictly typed language wont allow variables which hold data of one type to hold data of another type. for ex in C/C++ if one say variable v1 is of integer type,you have to store only integers in that v1 variable.you cannot store strings or characters into that v1 variable.Further more in strictly typed languages we have to declare all the variables before the actual code starts.</p>  
 <p> Perl is <b>a Loosely typed language</b>.Perl has only 3 basic data types<br>
 <ol type="1">
  <li>Scalars - denoted by a $ symbol</li>
  <li>Arrays -denoted by a @ symbol</li>
  <li>Hashes -denoted by a % symbol</li>
  </ol>
There is also another type called <i>typeglob</i> but it is not considered as true datatype.</p> 
<p> We shall discuss about data types  in the next chapter. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<P>Excercises:<br>
1)write a perl program to print a protein sequence.<br>
2) Remove the shebang line from the above program. What message is displayed when you try to run the program now?Are you able to run the program?Why?
