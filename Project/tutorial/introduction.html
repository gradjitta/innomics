       so what is perl?why should one learn perl? how is it different from C/C++ and java?why C/C++ and java aren't enough for biological 
	problems?Is perl enough for a biologist?Can we solve any problem through perl?Well..... all these queries will be solved in this introduction section.</p>

	<p><b>"Since many researchers who describe their work as "bioinformatics" don't program at all,
but rather, use programs written by others, it's tempting to ask, "Do I really need to learn
programming to do bioinformatics?" At one level, the answer is no, you don't. You can
accomplish quite a bit using existing tools, and there are books and documentation
available to help you learn those tools. But at another, higher level, the answer to the
question changes. What happens when you want to do something a preexisting tool
doesn't do? What happens when you can't find a tool to accomplish a particular task, and
you can't find someone to write it for you?
At that point, you need to learn to program. And even if you still rely mainly on existing
programs and tools, it can be worthwhile to learn enough to write small programs. Small
programs can be incredibly useful. For example, with a bit of practice, you can learn to
write programs that run other programs and spare yourself hours sitting in front of the
computer doing things by hand.
Many scientists start out writing small programs and find that they really like
programming. As a programmer, you never need to worry about finding the right tools
for your needs; you can write them yourself."</b></p>
<p>This is the text that is directly taken from book <b><i>Beggining perl for bioinformatics[o'reilly]</i></b>which is the first book i ve read for perl</p>
<p><b>Perl</b> is a programming language that is familiar to anyone who uses unix operating system.It is developed by <b><i>Larry wall</i></b>.
Perl is a general purpose programming language which can be used for variety of tasks like System admimistration,Network programming,text processing,
Bioinformatics,Web developement,software engineering etc etc....a lotta them.</p>
<p><h3>why perl is suited for biological problems and why not c/c++ or java?</h3></p>
<p> The answer is straight!!! because remaining languages cannot match the complexity of the biology!!!!<br>
I will explain this in a simple way......i.e by showing you an example</p>
<p>say you have two DNA strings "AGCTGCTGTGCGTGCATTGCTGC".Now your task is to find mrna from this dna string..i.e to transcribe it.
<br>
So here goes a C program for that
<PRE>
#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include&lt;conio.h&gt;
char a[]="AGCTGCTGTGCGTGCATTGCTGC";
char *p;
int i=0,length=0;
p=&a[0];
while(*p!='\0')
{
if(*p=='T')
{
a[i]="U";
}
length=++i;
p++;
} 
printf("The transcribed DNA string is");
for(i=0;i&lt;length;i++)
{
	printf("%s",a[i]);
}
</PRE>
</p>
<p>I really thinks this program works....I have stopped working in C a long time back!!!</p>
<p><b>Now check the same progam in perl</b><br>
<PRE>
#!usr/bin/perl -w
$str="AGCTGCTGTGCGTGCATTGCTGC";
$str=~s/T/U/g;
print $str;
</PRE>
</p>
<p>BY this time I guess you have clearly understood the difference between perl and C/C++.<br>
The main advantage of perl is its efficiency of text processing.C/C++,JAVA really lacks that.while a typical program in C/C++/JAVA takes some 100lines of code ..it may get finished in only 15-20 lines in perl</p>
<p>Imagine that u have to open a protein file which is in swissprot format and have to fetch sequence data from it...in C or C++ it may take minimum of 2-300 lines while in perl u may finish it up in &lt50 lines code!!!!!</p>
<p> Perl's  benefits
   <ol>
      <li>Ease of programming</li>
      <li>Rapid developement</li>
      <li>Portability,speed and maintainence</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
<p>Portability means compliance of any software or program across many platforms..I mean once if you write a program in perl on any platform say windows..you can = run the same program on any other platforms like LINUX,Mac,Solaris etc ...with no modification or minor modifications in thr originalprogram</p>

<p><b>Thats it for the introduction.I think  by now u know why to use perl for solving biological problems...We shall continue with PERL installation issues in the next chapter!</b></p>
