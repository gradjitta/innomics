<h3>The Trip<b><br> by</b> <b>3:5 6:4 4:2 6:4 5:8 6:18 5:8 6:4 1:6</b> </h3>
<b>Dec 26th 2008</b><br><br> 
This is the day when me and my friends started most memorable trip of our life time.
Asrar’s beautiful home , aunty’s amazing hospitality and delicious food , all combined we had a blast 
during our trip.<br><br>That night was more than magical. We laughed untill we cried . We gals who actually
saw a play station for the first time had so much fun when we played against guys. And without 
breaking our group’s tradition we played dumb charades. Jithin’s acting to describe cow was a real treat.
The feeling of so much joy in our mind which seems like it might pop out of our skin at any moment
that’s how we felt thru out the game.<br><br> The next day was earmarked for the local trip. We started 
off with our visit to horseley hills  which is a beautiful hill station. As we travelled through the narrow
roads of Horseley hills  different varieties of trees and flowers greeted us happily.  Panoramic view of
pristine hills seems like conversing with the blue sky. Thru out the visit we all felt a deep connection
with the nature and the breathtaking scenic beauty of this place. And the best part of the entire HH
visit was our “ Trecking episode”. Though lil bit terrifying because of our weird guide overall it was 
IMBA experience. <br><br>The most incredible part of this trip  is  the creation of  “<b id="roopa"> SWAROOPA</b>” and 
“<b id="swb">SYBERIAN WONDER BABIES</b>”. A great bonding time we all had is also something we cherished for 
who knows when we’re going to be this way again. It was a fabulous and P.E.R.F.E.C.T  trip. 
This trip had the best of everything from trecking , just challenging enough to delicious dining , 
best way to end a day, Aditya’s poor jokes to Jithin’s Malayalam classes . And this trip reached 
its end at bus stop in tirupati. After this three awesome days , we weren’t jus a group of happy 
youngsters heading back to our routine lifes, but there was a intense feeling deep inside going with us.
Just like all other trips , even in this trip we had discovered several new facts about each other and 
we were all like one happy bunch. We bade good byes  and  parted but there was no nostalgic feeling
cos we already planned our next trip :)
