<PRE>THIS GAME HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BIOLOGY...... SO ANYONE CAN PLAY IT

THE MAIN  AIM OF THE PLAYER IS TO GUESS THE 5 LETTER WORD WHICH IS GENERATED BY THE SYSTEM WHEN HE PRESSES THE START BUTTON

SUPPOSE THE SYSTEM GENERATED STRING IS ABCDE --(YOUR AIM IS TO FIND THIS STRING--HERE I HAVE SHOWN FOR EXAMPLE- AND NO REPEATS OF ALPHABETS IN THIS 5 LETTER WORD)
 
NOW YOU HAVE TO START GAME BY ENTERING ANY 5 LETTER INTO TEXTBOX---(WITHOUT REPETITION OF ALPHABETS)

SUPPOSE YOU HAVE ENTERED      BGCFD

NOW  AFTER YOU PRESS SUBMIT BUTTON SYSTEM WILL GIVE ALPHA AND BETA VALUES

ALPHA--THE NUMBER OF ALPHABETS THAT ARE COMMON IN YOUR STRING AND SYSTEM GENERATED STRING ALONG WITH THEIR POSITIONS ALSO. 

BETA0 THE NUMBER OF ALPHABETS THAT ARE COMMON IN YOUR AND SYSTEM STRING BUT POSITIONS OF THAT ALPHABETS IN BOTH STRINGS ARE NOT EQUAL

EX: SYSTEM STRING ABCDE (this is the string youhave to find based on alpha and beta .here i have show just for example)
      YOUR STRING     BGCFD 
 
         COMPARE THE TWO STRING ABOVE
  YOU HAVE ALPHABETS B,C,D COMMON IN BOTH THE STRINGS
  
  BUT ONLY ALPHABET C IS  COMMON IN BOTH THE STRINGS AND ITS POSITION IS ALSO EQUAL (POSITION 3 )- SO  ONE ALPHA NOW
 
 AND  ALTHOUGH B AND D ARE COMMON THEIR POSITION IS NOT COMMON -- SO 2 BETA

THIS IS IT
 AS YOU KEEP ON ENTERING THE 5 LETTER WORDS THE SYSTEM WILL COMPARE THEM WITH THE SYSTEM WORD AND WILL GIVE YOU VALUES OF ALPHA AND BETA

BASED ON THAT VALUES YOUHAVE TO ARRIVE AT SYSTEM WORD.....I.E IF U GET 5 ALPHA THAT MEANS YOU HAVE GUESSED THE CORRECT WORD......

HOPE THIS IS CLEAR.......IF U PLAY SOME 2 TO 3 TIMES U WILL BE CLEAR
