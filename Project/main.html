<p class="one">Heat shock proteins (HSPs), also called <i>stress proteins</i>, are a group of proteins that are present in all cells in all life forms. They are induced
 when a cell undergoes various types of environmental stresses like heat, cold and oxygen deprivation.Heat shock proteins are also present in cells
 under perfectly normal conditions. 
 They act like ‘chaperones,’ making sure that the cell’s proteins are in the right shape and in the right place at the right time.</p>
<p>The HSPs are named according to their molecular weights, for example Hsp70 and Hsp90 each define families of chaperones.They play an important role in
 protein-protein interactions such as folding and assisting in the establishment of proper protein conformation (shape) and prevention of unwanted protein aggregation.
By helping to stabilize partially unfolded proteins, HSPs aid in transporting proteins across membranes within the cell.
